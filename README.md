## Fluence NFTs

The Fluence NFTs are designed to represent different user groups by elements linked together in different network topologies.

Here are some example configurations representing the way that Fluence can link financial, digital and natural networks.

## Rarity

Rarity is supported through:

* Different network configurations: Ring, star, mesh.
* Different backgrounds (dependent on NFT type)
* Different nodes (dependent on NFT type)

**The rarity can be configured on request by selecting specific configurations or by using random generation.**

The images are generated from NFT metadata passed to Blender 2.8 scripts. All the options and schemes are shown in the [NFT_User_Guide](https://github.com/ben-razor/fluence-artwork/blob/main/NFT_USER_GUIDE.md)
